# Real-Time Finger Counting with Computer Vision

![Project Demo](demo.png)

This repository contains the code and resources for a real-time finger counting system using computer vision techniques. The project leverages OpenCV and the MediaPipe library to detect and track hand landmarks in live video streams, enabling accurate finger counting.

## Features

- Real-time hand detection and tracking
- Finger landmark extraction
- Finger counting algorithm
- Visualization of hand tracking and finger counting results

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the project:

- Python 
- OpenCV 
- MediaPipe

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fatemeh-Farnaghizadeh/HandTracking_Project.git
